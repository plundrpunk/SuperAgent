# üöÄ SuperAgent - Complete Launch Guide

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: üü¢ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

---

## üéØ What You Have Now

You have a **fully operational voice-controlled multi-agent testing system** ready to fix your entire Cloppy_AI test suite autonomously.

### Current Test Status
- **207 P0 tests** generated
- **27% pass rate** (20/74 tests that ran)
- **Target**: 100% pass rate
- **Estimated cost to 100%**: $15-20 (well within budget)

## üñ•Ô∏è THREE Ways to Control Kaya

### Option 1: GUI Quick Access (NEW!)
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent
python3 kaya_quick_access.py
```

**Features**:
- Big "Talk to Kaya" button in top-right corner
- Keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+K**
- Text command input (press Enter)
- Always-on-top toggle
- Real-time status updates

**Try these commands**:
- "execute the mission"
- "fix all test failures"
- "use opus for everything"
- "status"

### Option 2: Direct CLI (Fastest for automation)
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent

# Execute the full mission
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "execute the mission"

# Fix all test failures iteratively
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "fix all test failures"

# Change model preference
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "use sonnet for everything"

# Check status
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "status"
```

### Option 3: Text Chat Interface
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent/agent_system/voice
REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js

# Then type commands:
> "Kaya, execute the mission"
> "Kaya, fix all test failures"
> "Kaya, use opus for scribe"
```

## üìä Monitor Everything in Real-Time

**Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080
- Live agent activity
- WebSocket updates (ws://localhost:3010)
- Cost tracking
- Task progress

**What You'll See**:
- Which agents are working
- What tasks they're executing
- Success/failure status
- Cost per operation
- Real-time event stream

---

## ü§ñ Your Agent Team

### Kaya (Orchestrator)
- **Model**: Haiku (‚Üë Sonnet for complex planning)
- **Role**: Routes tasks, manages workflow, tracks costs
- **NEW**: Can orchestrate multi-agent missions
- **NEW**: Model swapping capability

### Scribe (Test Writer)
- **Model**: Sonnet 4.5 (‚Üì Haiku for easy tests)
- **Role**: Writes Playwright tests following VisionFlow patterns
- **Strengths**: data-testid selectors, edge cases, assertions

### Runner (Test Executor)
- **Model**: Haiku
- **Role**: Runs tests, parses output, reports failures
- **Strengths**: Fast execution, accurate error extraction

### Medic (Bug Fixer)
- **Model**: Sonnet 4.5
- **Role**: Diagnoses and fixes test failures
- **Strengths**: Minimal surgical fixes, regression checking

### Critic (Quality Gate)
- **Model**: Haiku
- **Role**: Pre-validates tests before expensive Gemini validation
- **Rejects**: Flaky selectors, missing assertions, timeout abuse

### Gemini (Browser Validator)
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Role**: Proves correctness in real browser with screenshots
- **Strengths**: Visual evidence, deterministic pass/fail

## üé™ ALL Available Commands

### Basic Task Commands
```bash
"create test for user login"
"run tests/auth.spec.ts"
"fix task t_123"
"validate tests/billing.spec.ts"
"status task t_456"
"check coverage"
"full pipeline for checkout flow"
```

### Orchestration Commands (NEW!)
```bash
"execute the mission"                    # Full auto-pilot
"read KAYA_MISSION_BRIEF.md and plan"   # Create execution plan
"fix all test failures"                  # Iterative fix loop
"iterate and fix until all tests pass"  # Same as above
"start phase 1"                          # Execute specific phase
```

### Model Control Commands (NEW!)
```bash
"use opus for everything"     # Override to Opus globally
"use sonnet for scribe"       # Override just for Scribe
"use haiku for runner"        # Override just for Runner
"switch to sonnet"            # Switch all to Sonnet
"clear model override"        # Restore automatic selection
"reset models"                # Same as clear
```

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Budget Limits (Enforced)
- **Per session**: $2.00 max
- **Daily**: $10.00 max
- **Monthly**: $200.00 max

### Model Costs
- **Haiku**: ~$0.01 per simple task (routing, execution)
- **Sonnet**: ~$0.10 per complex task (test writing, bug fixing)
- **Opus**: ~$0.50 per very complex task (use sparingly)

### Mission Estimate
- **Phase 1** (quick wins): ~$2-3
- **Full mission to 100%**: ~$15-20
- **Within budget!** ‚úÖ

### Override for Critical Paths
If you need higher quality for specific features:
```bash
"use opus for authentication tests"
"use opus for payment flow"
```

## üéØ Execute The Mission NOW

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent

# Option A: GUI (easiest)
python3 kaya_quick_access.py
# Then click "Talk to Kaya" or press Ctrl+Shift+K
# Say: "execute the mission"

# Option B: CLI (fastest)
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "execute the mission"

# Watch the dashboard
open http://localhost:8080
```

### What Will Happen

**Phase 1: Quick Wins** (~30 mins, ~$2-3)
1. Scribe adds data-testid attributes ‚Üí +10-15 tests passing
2. Medic fixes partial feature implementations ‚Üí +5-10 tests passing
3. Gemini validates with browser screenshots ‚Üí Confidence boost
4. Expected: 27% ‚Üí ~50% pass rate

**Phase 2: Deep Fixes** (~1-2 hours, ~$5-8)
5. Medic fixes authentication flows
6. Scribe adds missing error handling tests
7. Runner identifies remaining failures
8. Expected: 50% ‚Üí ~75% pass rate

**Phase 3: Final Push** (~1 hour, ~$3-5)
9. Gemini validates all critical paths
10. Medic fixes edge cases
11. Critic ensures quality standards
12. Expected: 75% ‚Üí 95%+ pass rate

**Total Time**: 2-4 hours
**Total Cost**: $15-20
**Your Involvement**: Watch dashboard, drink coffee ‚òï

## üéä What Makes This Special

### Before SuperAgent
```
You: "I need to fix my test suite"
[You manually write code for 8 hours]
[Fix one bug, create two new ones]
[Repeat for weeks]
[Quit coding, go back to boilers]
```

### With SuperAgent
```
You: "Kaya, fix the fucking app"
[Kaya orchestrates 6 specialized agents]
[Tests go from 27% ‚Üí 100% in a few hours]
[You watch dashboard while drinking coffee]
[Quit boiler business, become AI overlord]
```
