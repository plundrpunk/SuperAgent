# Documentation Summary: Status Reports & Miscellaneous

This document synthesizes various status reports, implementation summaries, and bug fix notes to provide a high-level overview of the SuperAgent project's progress and key features.

---

## 1. High-Level Project Status

-   **Overall Status**: The SuperAgent system is described as **fully operational** and **production-ready**. All core components, including the six specialized agents (Kaya, Scribe, Critic, Runner, Medic, Gemini), have been implemented.
-   **Primary Mission**: The main objective is to use the autonomous multi-agent system to fix the entire test suite for a project named "Cloppy_AI" until 100% of its 207 critical (P0) tests are passing.
-   **Current Test Pass Rate**: The mission started with a **27%** pass rate.

## 2. Key Implemented Systems & Features

Based on the various implementation summaries, the following major systems have been completed and documented:

-   **Docker Containerization**: A production-ready, multi-stage Docker setup is complete, containerizing the application and its Redis dependency. It includes health checks, resource limits, and a non-root user configuration for security.

-   **Observability System**: A comprehensive monitoring system is in place, featuring:
    -   A **WebSocket server** for real-time event streaming.
    -   A visual **dashboard** to monitor agent activity, costs, and metrics.
    -   **Structured JSONL logging** with automatic daily rotation, compression, and cleanup.

-   **Cost Analytics & Budgeting**: The system actively tracks costs per agent, model, and feature. It enforces budget limits by issuing warnings at 80% usage and a hard stop at 100%.

-   **Security Hardening**: A security audit was performed, and critical vulnerabilities were fixed. This includes:
    -   Fixing **path traversal** and **command injection** vulnerabilities.
    -   Implementing a **secure sandbox** for test execution with resource limits.
    -   Adding a **zero-downtime API key rotation** system.

-   **Error Recovery & Self-Healing**: The system is designed for resilience.
    -   **Graceful Shutdown**: The application handles `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` signals to finish active tasks and clean up resources before exiting.
    -   **Automatic Retries**: API calls that fail due to transient issues (like network errors or rate limits) are automatically retried with exponential backoff.
    -   **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents the system from repeatedly calling an external service that is down.
    -   **Self-Diagnosis**: The Runner agent can diagnose its own test failures, identifying environmental issues like a non-running server and providing actionable fix commands.

-   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: The **Scribe** (test writer) agent is integrated with a vector database. It queries for similar, previously successful test patterns to improve the quality and consistency of newly generated tests.

-   **Agent Self-Validation**: The **Scribe** agent validates its own generated code against a set of quality rules (the same ones used by the Critic agent). If the code fails validation, Scribe automatically retries up to 3 times, refining the code based on the feedback.

## 3. Notable Bug Fixes

-   **Directory Path Parsing**: A critical bug was fixed where the Kaya agent was not correctly parsing directory paths from user commands (e.g., `"fix all tests in /path/to/project"`), which prevented the system from targeting the correct files.
-   **Test Execution Timeout**: The default timeout for running tests was increased from 60s to 180s, as the original timeout was too short for E2E tests to complete, leading to false negatives.
-   **Redis Dependency**: The system was modified to make Redis optional. It can now run in a degraded mode without Redis, which simplifies local setup.
