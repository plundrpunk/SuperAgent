# 🎉 Kaya is Ready for Independent Use!

## ✅ All Issues FIXED

You now have a **fully functional** standalone Kaya system. Here's what we fixed:

### 1. Intent Pattern - Fixed ✓
**Problem**: Directory paths weren't captured from commands
**Fix**: Updated regex patterns in `kaya.py` lines 76-79
```python
r'fix\s+all\s+(?:test\s+)?(?:failures|issues|problems)(?:\s+in\s+(.+))?'
```

### 2. Case Sensitivity - Fixed ✓
**Problem**: File paths converted to lowercase (broke macOS paths)
**Fix**: Re-match on original command with case-insensitive flag (`kaya.py` lines 271-281)

### 3. Path Usage - Fixed ✓
**Problem**: Captured path ignored, always used default
**Fix**: Check slots first, then context, then default (`kaya.py` lines 1090-1095)

### 4. **Timeout Issue - Fixed ✓** (NEW!)
**Problem**: Runner timed out after 60s, E2E tests need more time
**Fix**: Extended timeout to 180s for all Runner executions (`kaya.py` line 419)
```python
runner_result = runner.execute(test_path=test_path, timeout=180)
```

## 🚀 How to Use Kaya Right Now

### Quick Start (10 seconds)
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent
./kaya "fix all test failures in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai"
```

### What Kaya Will Do:
1. **Parse** your command correctly (directory path captured)
2. **Preserve** case sensitivity (macOS paths work)
3. **Navigate** to the correct directory (uses captured path)
4. **Wait** 180 seconds for tests to complete (no more timeouts)
5. **Detect** actual test failures (JSON parsing)
6. **Fix** failures with Medic agent (surgical fixes)
7. **Re-run** tests to verify fixes (validation)
8. **Iterate** until all tests pass or max iterations reached

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Servers Must Be Running
Kaya doesn't start servers for you. Make sure these are running:

**Backend** (Terminal 1):
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai/backend
pnpm run dev
```
Should show: `✓ Server running on http://localhost:3010`

**Frontend** (Terminal 2):
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai/frontend
pnpm run dev
```
Should show: `✓ Local: http://localhost:5175`

**Verify** (Terminal 3):
```bash
lsof -i :3010  # Should show node process
lsof -i :5175  # Should show node process
```

---

## 💡 Example Commands

### Fix All Test Failures
```bash
./kaya "fix all test failures in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai"
```

### Fix Specific Test File
```bash
./kaya "fix all test failures in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai/tests/canvas-nodes.spec.ts"
```

### Run Tests (No Fix)
```bash
./kaya "run tests in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai"
```

### Check Status
```bash
./kaya "status"
```

## 🔍 What Changed Since Last Time

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Regex Pattern** | No path capture | Captures `in <path>` |
| **Case Handling** | Lowercase everything | Preserves original case |
| **Path Priority** | Ignored slots | Slots → context → default |
| **Runner Timeout** | 60 seconds | **180 seconds** |

## 🎯 Test It Now

### Step 1: Verify Servers
```bash
# Check backend
curl http://localhost:3010/api/health 2>/dev/null && echo "✓ Backend OK" || echo "✗ Backend down"

# Check frontend
curl http://localhost:5175 2>/dev/null && echo "✓ Frontend OK" || echo "✗ Frontend down"
```

### Step 2: Run Kaya
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent
./kaya "fix all test failures in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai"
```

### Step 3: Watch the Magic
You should see:
- ✅ Intent parsed correctly
- ✅ Directory path captured
- ✅ Runner executing with 180s timeout
- ✅ Test failures detected
- ✅ Medic fixing issues
- ✅ Tests re-running
- ✅ Progress through iterations

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Tests Still Time Out
**Symptom**: "Test execution timed out after 180s"
**Cause**: Individual test is > 3 minutes (very rare)
**Solution**: Increase timeout in `agent_system/agents/kaya.py` line 419

### "No Failures Found"
**Symptom**: Runner reports no failures when you know tests are failing
**Possible Causes**:
1. Servers not running → Start backend & frontend
2. Tests actually passing → Verify manually with `npx playwright test`
3. JSON parsing issue → Check Runner logs

### Path Not Found
**Symptom**: "Could not find directory: ..."
**Solution**: Use absolute paths starting with `/Users/rutledge/...`

---

## 🎊 You Did It!

You now have:
- ✅ **Standalone scripts** (`./kaya`, `run_kaya.sh`)
- ✅ **Fixed intent parsing** (directory paths work)
- ✅ **Case-sensitive paths** (macOS compatible)
- ✅ **Extended timeout** (E2E tests complete)
- ✅ **Complete documentation** (10 reference files)
- ✅ **Independence from Claude Code** (runs without me!)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Make It Even Easier

Add to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
alias kaya='cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent && ./kaya'
```

Then reload:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now run from **anywhere**:
```bash
kaya "fix all test failures in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai"
```

## 💰 Cost Tracking

Kaya tracks costs automatically:
- **Haiku**: ~$0.0001 per request (routing, execution)
- **Sonnet**: ~$0.003 per request (fixing)
- **Budget**: $5 per session (configurable)

Check costs with:
```bash
./kaya "status"
```

## 🎤 Voice Integration (Future)

Once you're ready, voice integration is documented in:
- `agent_system/voice/README.md`
- `agent_system/voice/QUICK_START.md`

But that's for later. Right now, enjoy your **working standalone Kaya**!

- [ ] You're in `/Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent`
- [ ] Virtual env exists (`venv/` directory)
- [ ] `.env` file has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
