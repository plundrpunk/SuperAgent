# Lifecycle Management Quick Reference

## 30-Second Overview

SuperAgent now has graceful shutdown that:
- Stops accepting new tasks when SIGTERM/SIGINT received
- Waits for active tasks to complete (30s timeout)
- Cleans up Redis, Vector DB, and WebSocket connections
- Handles orphaned tasks from crashes
- Works with Docker, Kubernetes, and bare metal

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Setup (3 lines)

```python
from agent_system.lifecycle import setup_lifecycle

lifecycle = setup_lifecycle()  # Registers signal handlers
lifecycle.mark_started()        # Service is now healthy
```

### 2. Track Tasks (5 lines)

```python
task_id = "task_123"
lifecycle.add_active_task(task_id, agent="scribe", feature="login")

try:
    do_work()
finally:
    lifecycle.remove_active_task(task_id)
```

### 3. Register Connections (1 line each)

```python
lifecycle.register_connection("redis", redis_client)
lifecycle.register_connection("vector_db", vector_client)
lifecycle.register_connection("websocket", websocket_server, close_method="stop")
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Check service health
python agent_system/cli.py health

# Test graceful shutdown (sends SIGTERM)
docker compose down

# View logs during shutdown
docker compose logs -f superagent
```

## Check Shutdown Status

```python
# Before starting work
if lifecycle.is_shutting_down():
    return error_response("Service shutting down")

# Or check if can accept
if not lifecycle.can_accept_tasks():
    return error_response("Cannot accept tasks")
```

## Shutdown Sequence (Automatic)

```
1. SIGTERM received
2. Stop accepting new tasks
3. Wait for active tasks (max 30s)
4. Call shutdown callbacks
5. Close all connections
6. Flush logs
7. Exit cleanly
```

## Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "active_tasks": 2,
  "connections": {
    "redis": "✓",
    "vector_db": "✓"
  },
  "can_accept_tasks": true
}
```

## Orphaned Task Recovery

```python
# Detect tasks stuck from previous crash
orphaned = lifecycle.check_orphaned_tasks(redis_client)

# Reset them to failed (can retry)
lifecycle.recover_orphaned_tasks(redis_client, orphaned)

# Or clear them completely
lifecycle.clear_orphaned_tasks(redis_client, orphaned)
```

## Docker Configuration

```yaml
superagent:
  stop_signal: SIGTERM
  stop_grace_period: 45s  # Time to complete tasks
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit/test_lifecycle.py -v

# Run demo
python3 test_lifecycle_demo.py

# Test Docker shutdown
docker compose up -d && sleep 5 && docker compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Tasks don't complete | Increase timeout in `shutdown(timeout=60)` |
| Connections leak | Verify `close()` method exists |
| Shutdown takes too long | Check tasks respect `is_shutting_down()` |
| Orphaned tasks persist | Call `recover_orphaned_tasks()` at startup |

## Best Practices

1. **Always register connections**: `lifecycle.register_connection(name, conn)`
2. **Always track long tasks**: Use `add_active_task()` / `remove_active_task()`
3. **Check shutdown status**: Check `is_shutting_down()` in loops
4. **Use finally blocks**: Ensure task cleanup even on errors
5. **Set appropriate timeouts**: 30s for most, 60s for heavy tasks

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] Call `setup_lifecycle()` in main()
- [ ] Call `lifecycle.mark_started()` after init
- [ ] Register all connections
- [ ] Track all long-running operations
- [ ] Check `can_accept_tasks()` before work
- [ ] Use `finally` blocks for cleanup
- [ ] Test with `docker compose down`
