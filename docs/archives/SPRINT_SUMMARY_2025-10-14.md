```python
# Automatic on SIGTERM/SIGINT
lifecycle = setup_lifecycle()
lifecycle.add_active_task("task_123")
try:
    do_work()

```python
@limit_anthropic(model='claude-sonnet-4.5')
def call_api():
    # Automatically retries on 429 with exponential backoff
    # Falls back to in-memory if Redis unavailable
    return client.messages.create(...)
```

### Two-Phase Gemini Validation
