## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "No microphone access"
The voice examples use text input by default - just type your commands!

### "Command not found: node"
```bash
# Install Node.js first
brew install node
```

### "OpenAI API key error"
Check your `.env` file has:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## 🚀 Ready to Go!

```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent/agent_system/voice
node dist/examples.js
```

Then type (or speak): **"Kaya, write a test for Cloppy AI authentication"**

Watch the magic! 🎉
