# 🤖 Daily Agent Setup - SuperAgent as Your Work Partner

Your agents are now **production-ready** with MCP integration!

---

## ✅ Setup Checklist

### 1. Dependencies Installed
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent

# Check Python dependencies
venv/bin/pip list | grep -E "redis|anthropic|openai"

# Check Node dependencies
cd agent_system/voice && npm list | grep -E "openai|ioredis"
```

### 2. Services Running
```bash
# Check Redis
redis-cli ping  # Should return "PONG"

# Start SuperAgent (if not running)
./start_superagent.sh
```

### 3. Test MCP Integration
```bash
cd agent_system/voice
REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js

# Then type:
> "Kaya, create a project called Test"
# Should see: ✅ Created project: Test
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Morning Routine
```bash
# 1. Start SuperAgent
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent
./start_superagent.sh

# 2. Launch text chat
cd agent_system/voice
REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js

# 3. Check yesterday's work
> "Kaya, what did I work on yesterday?"

# 4. Plan today
> "Kaya, create project: Boiler System Refactor"
> "Kaya, add task: review error logs"
```

### During Work
```bash
# Brainstorm
> "Kaya, help me think through reducing API latency"

# Code generation
> "Kaya, write tests for the payment flow"

# Bug fixing
> "Kaya, fix the failing authentication tests"

# Analysis
> "Kaya, analyze test coverage for user module"
```

### End of Day
```bash
> "Kaya, summary of today's work"
> "Kaya, commit changes with smart message"
> "Kaya, what's on deck for tomorrow?"
```

## 💼 Work Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Reducing Boilerplate
```
You: "Kaya, I'm tired of writing the same error handling code in every controller. Help me design a better pattern."

Kaya: "Let me analyze your current error handling patterns...

I see 47 controllers with similar try-catch blocks. Here are 3 approaches:

1. **Error Middleware** (recommended)
   - Centralized handling
   - Consistent responses
   - Easy to extend

2. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Clean syntax
   - Type-safe
   - Per-method control

3. **Result Pattern**
   - Explicit errors
   - No exceptions
   - Functional style

Which approach interests you most?"

You: "Show me the error middleware approach"

Kaya: "Let me write a proof-of-concept..."
[Scribe agent generates code]
```

### Scenario 2: Debug Production Issue
```
You: "Kaya, production is showing 'connection timeout' errors for the payment service. Help me debug."

Kaya: "Analyzing payment service...

Found potential issues:
1. Connection pool exhausted (max: 10)
2. No retry logic on timeout
3. Long-running queries (>5s)

Would you like me to:
A) Check recent logs for patterns
B) Generate monitoring dashboard
C) Implement retry with backoff"

You: "Do all three"

Kaya: [Routes to multiple agents in parallel]
```

### Scenario 3: Code Review Before PR
```
You: "Kaya, review my changes before I create a PR"

Kaya: "Analyzing git diff...

**Critic Review:**
✅ Clean code structure
✅ Tests included
⚠️  Missing error cases in tests
❌ No documentation for new API

**Recommendations:**
1. Add error case tests (lines 42-65)
2. Update API.md with new endpoint
3. Consider rate limiting on /bulk endpoint

Would you like me to add these improvements?"
```

## 🎯 Agent Specializations

### Kaya (Your Manager)
**Use for**: Orchestration, planning, status updates
```
"Kaya, route this to the right agent"
"Kaya, what's the status of all tasks?"
"Kaya, create project roadmap"
```

### Scribe (Your Developer)
**Use for**: Writing code, tests, documentation
```
"Kaya, have Scribe write integration tests"
"Kaya, generate API documentation"
"Kaya, implement the retry logic we discussed"
```

### Runner (Your QA)
**Use for**: Running tests, validating behavior
```
"Kaya, run all tests and report failures"
"Kaya, check if authentication still works"
"Kaya, benchmark the new query performance"
```

### Medic (Your Debugger)
**Use for**: Fixing bugs, regression testing
```
"Kaya, fix the failing test in auth.spec.ts"
"Kaya, debug why payments are timing out"
"Kaya, patch the security vulnerability"
```

### Critic (Your Code Reviewer)
**Use for**: Quality gates, pre-commit checks
```
"Kaya, review before I commit"
"Kaya, check if this follows our standards"
"Kaya, validate test quality"
```

### Gemini (Your Validator)
**Use for**: Browser validation, visual testing
```
"Kaya, validate the checkout flow works end-to-end"
"Kaya, check if UI matches designs"
"Kaya, prove this works in real browser"
```

## 📊 Tracking Your Work

### Weekly Review
```bash
# Every Friday
> "Kaya, show this week's statistics"
> "Kaya, what are my top accomplishments?"
> "Kaya, where did I spend most time?"
> "Kaya, export weekly report for standup"
```

### Monthly Metrics
```bash
# First Monday of month
> "Kaya, show last month's metrics"
> "Kaya, which projects need attention?"
> "Kaya, what's my code quality trend?"
> "Kaya, compare to previous month"
```

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Add Your Own Agents
```python
# agent_system/agents/architect.py
class ArchitectAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Your personal solutions architect"""

    def execute(self, design_problem: str):
        # Your custom logic
        pass

# Then use it:
> "Kaya, have Architect design the new microservice"
```

### Custom Workflows
```yaml
# .claude/workflows/deploy.yaml
name: "Full Deployment Pipeline"
steps:
  - agent: scribe
    task: "Write deployment script"
  - agent: critic
    task: "Review deployment safety"
  - agent: runner
    task: "Run staging deployment"
  - agent: gemini
    task: "Validate in staging"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Responding
```bash
# Check Redis
redis-cli ping

# Restart SuperAgent
./start_superagent.sh

# Check logs
tail -f logs/kaya.log
```

### MCP Not Saving
```bash
# Check MCP connection
> "Kaya, test MCP connection"

# Verify project exists
> "Kaya, list all projects"
```

### Cost Tracking Issues
```bash
# Check budget status
> "Kaya, show budget status"

# Reset if needed
> "Kaya, reset cost tracking"
```

---

## 💰 Cost Management

### Typical Costs
- **Brainstorming**: $0.01-0.05 per session
- **Test generation**: $0.10-0.50 per suite
- **Bug fixing**: $0.05-0.20 per fix
- **Code review**: $0.02-0.10 per review

### Budget Alerts
```python
# In router.py
BUDGET_LIMITS = {
    'per_session': 2.00,  # Max $2 per session
    'daily': 10.00,       # Max $10 per day
    'monthly': 200.00     # Max $200 per month
}
```
