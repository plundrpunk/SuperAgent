# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation, implementation summaries, and status reports that have been superseded by the comprehensive documentation in the [docs/](../docs/) directory and the summaries in [current_arch_docs_summed/](../current_arch_docs_summed/).

## Why These Are Archived

These documents were created during the development and implementation phases of SuperAgent. They contain valuable historical context but are no longer the primary source of truth. The information they contain has been:

1. **Consolidated** into comprehensive guides in [docs/](../docs/)
2. **Summarized** in category-specific summaries in [current_arch_docs_summed/](../current_arch_docs_summed/)
3. **Superseded** by newer, more accurate documentation
