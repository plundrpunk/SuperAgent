# ðŸ§  Using SuperAgent as Your Brainstorm Partner

## Quick Start

1. **Start SuperAgent:**
   ```bash
   ./start_superagent.sh
   ```

2. **Launch Text Chat:**
   ```bash
   cd agent_system/voice
   REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js
   ```

3. **Brainstorm Away!**
   ```
   You: "Kaya, help me brainstorm how to reduce boilerplate code in our React components"
   You: "Kaya, what are the best patterns for error handling in our API?"
   You: "Kaya, help me think through this architecture decision..."
   ```

## Best Prompts for Brainstorming

- **"Help me think through..."** - Open-ended exploration
- **"What are the tradeoffs between..."** - Decision analysis
- **"How can we improve..."** - Optimization ideas
- **"What's the best way to..."** - Pattern recommendations

## Why Kaya is a Great Brainstorm Partner

- **Always Available** - 24/7, no meetings needed
- **No Judgment** - Ask "dumb" questions safely
- **Instant Response** - No waiting for replies
- **Context-Aware** - Knows your codebase
- **Multi-Agent** - Can route to specialists (Scribe, Medic, etc.)

## Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "help with tests", say "help me design a testing strategy for our payment flow"
2. **Iterate**: Have a conversation, refine ideas together
3. **Save Good Ideas**: Kaya can write them down as code/docs
4. **Use for Code Review**: "Review this approach and suggest improvements"

## Example Brainstorm Session

```
You: "Kaya, I'm trying to reduce our test execution time from 10 minutes to under 5. What strategies should I consider?"

Kaya: "Let me analyze your test suite and suggest optimizations:
1. Parallelize test execution
2. Mock expensive operations
3. Use test fixtures
4. Identify and fix slow tests
..."

You: "Great! Can you help me identify the slowest tests?"

Kaya: "Running analysis... [uses Runner agent to profile tests]"
```

## Need More Help?

Add more agents for specialized brainstorming:
- **Architect Agent** - System design decisions
- **Performance Agent** - Optimization strategies
