# 🎉 Kaya Enhancements - Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. Orchestration Capabilities

Kaya can now handle complex multi-agent missions:

**New Intents**:
- `read_and_plan` - Read documents and create execution plans
- `iterative_fix` - Run tests, fix failures, repeat until 100% pass
- `orchestrate_mission` - Execute full mission from KAYA_MISSION_BRIEF.md

**Example Commands**:
```bash
# Read mission brief and create plan
"Kaya, read KAYA_MISSION_BRIEF.md and create an execution plan"

# Fix all test failures iteratively
"Kaya, fix all test failures"
"Kaya, test and fix all issues"
"Kaya, fix the fucking app"

# Orchestrate full mission
"Kaya, execute the mission"
"Kaya, start phase 1"
"Kaya, read the mission brief"
```

### 2. Model Override System (In Progress)

Added infrastructure for model swapping:
- `self.model_override` - Override model selection
- `self.model_override_scope` - Apply to 'all' or specific agent

**To Complete** (next steps):
1. Add intent patterns for model selection
2. Create `_handle_set_model` method
3. Modify routing logic to respect overrides

**Planned Commands**:
```bash
"Kaya, use Opus for everything"
"Kaya, use Sonnet for Scribe"
"Kaya, use Haiku for Runner"
"Kaya, clear model override"
```

## 🚀 How to Use Enhanced Kaya

### Test the Orchestration

```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent

# Test reading and planning
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "read KAYA_MISSION_BRIEF.md and create a plan"

# Test iterative fixing
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "fix all test failures"

# Test mission orchestration
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "execute the mission"
```

### Via Text Chat

```bash
cd agent_system/voice
REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js

# Then type:
> "Kaya, read the mission brief"
> "Kaya, fix all test failures"
> "Kaya, execute the mission"
```

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

### Option A: Complete Model Swapping (15 min)
I can finish the model override feature so you can say:
- "Kaya, use Opus for this task"
- "Kaya, use Sonnet for all agents"

### Option B: Test Enhanced Kaya Now (0 min)
Try the new capabilities immediately:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "execute the mission"
```

### Option C: Start Fixing Cloppy_AI (Now!)
Use the enhanced Kaya to actually start fixing tests:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD venv/bin/python agent_system/cli.py kaya "fix all test failures"
```

## 🎉 What This Means

**You can now say**:
```
"Kaya, fix the fucking app"
```

**And Kaya will**:
1. Read the mission brief
2. Understand current status (27% pass rate)
3. Create execution plan
4. Run tests to identify failures
