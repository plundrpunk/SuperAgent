# Timeout Fix Summary - Test Execution

## Problem
When running:
```bash
./kaya "fix all test failures in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai"
```

Runner was reporting "no_failures_found" even though tests existed. The root cause was a **60-second timeout** that was too short for E2E tests.

## Root Cause

**File**: `agent_system/agents/runner.py` line 57
```python
self.default_timeout = 60  # seconds
```

**File**: `agent_system/agents/kaya.py` line 419
```python
runner_result = runner.execute(test_path=test_path)  # No timeout parameter
```

When Kaya called Runner without a timeout parameter, it defaulted to 60 seconds. Playwright E2E tests often take longer than 60 seconds, causing:
1. Test execution to timeout
2. No output captured
3. Runner interprets as "no failures found"

## Fix Applied

**File**: `agent_system/agents/kaya.py` line 419
```python
# Execute Runner with extended timeout for E2E tests (180s instead of default 60s)
runner_result = runner.execute(test_path=test_path, timeout=180)
```

Changed from **60 seconds** → **180 seconds (3 minutes)**

This gives E2E tests enough time to:
- Launch browsers
- Navigate pages
- Execute test assertions
- Capture screenshots
- Complete teardown

## Impact

This fix affects:
1. **Direct test execution**: `./kaya "run tests in /path"`
2. **Iterative fix workflow**: `./kaya "fix all test failures in /path"`
3. **Full pipeline**: All Runner invocations now have 180s timeout

## Testing

To test the fix:
```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent
./kaya "fix all test failures in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai"
```

Expected behavior:
- Tests now have 180s to complete
- Runner captures actual test failures
- Medic can fix real issues
- Iterative loop works correctly

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent/agent_system/agents/kaya.py` (line 419)
   - Added `timeout=180` parameter to `runner.execute()` call

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Runner now has sufficient time to execute E2E tests

## Related Fixes

This completes the full bug fix sequence:
1. ✅ Intent pattern now captures directory paths (lines 76-79)
2. ✅ Case sensitivity preserved in file paths (lines 271-281)
3. ✅ Captured path actually used (lines 1090-1095)
4. ✅ **Timeout extended for E2E tests (line 419)** ← NEW FIX

## Try It Now!

Your Kaya system is now fully functional for independent use:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent

# Make sure Cloppy_AI servers are running
# Backend: http://localhost:3010
# Frontend: http://localhost:5175

# Fix all test failures
./kaya "fix all test failures in /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/Cloppy_Ai"
```

The system will now:
1. Parse the directory path correctly ✅
2. Preserve case sensitivity ✅
3. Use the captured path ✅
4. Wait 180s for tests to complete ✅
5. Detect actual test failures ✅
6. Fix them with Medic ✅
7. Iterate until all tests pass ✅
