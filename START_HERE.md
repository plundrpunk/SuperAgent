# 🚀 START HERE - Autonomous Overnight Build

## The Mission

Build a **complete Cloppy AI test suite** while you sleep using fully autonomous AI agents.

## What You Get

- **40+ production-ready tests** for VisionFlow
- **Auto-validated** - every test actually works
- **Auto-fixed** - failures automatically debugged and patched
- **Complete coverage** - board management, auth, billing, AI chat, export, search, and more
- **Cost:** $5-10 total
- **Time:** 2-4 hours (autonomous)

## How It Works

```
You → "build me X" → Kaya → Scribe → Runner → Medic → Done!
                      ↓
                   Creates      Generates   Validates   Fixes
                   Project      Test        Execution   Failures
                   & Tasks      (Sonnet)    (Playwright)(Sonnet)
```

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Test the System (5 minutes)

First, validate the autonomous loop works:

```bash
cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent
./test_autonomous_loop.sh
```

This will generate a simple board creation test to prove everything works.

**Expected output:**
```
🧪 Testing Autonomous Build Loop
================================
🏗️  Building feature: board creation test
✅ Created project: proj_xxx
📋 Created 2 tasks
🚀 Starting autonomous execution...
📝 Task 1/2: Generate test: board creation test
✅ Scribe: Test generated at tests/board_creation.spec.ts
🏃 Runner: Validating test...
✅ Task 1 completed successfully
...
✅ Feature Build Complete! Completed: 2, Failed: 0
```

### Step 2: Start Overnight Build

Once Step 1 works, kick off the full build:

```bash
./build_complete_test_suite.sh
```

**This will:**
- Generate 40+ comprehensive tests
- Auto-validate each test runs correctly
- Auto-fix failures (up to 3 attempts per test)
- Track progress in Archon
- Run for 2-4 hours

**You can:**
- Close your laptop and go to bed 🛏️
- Let it run overnight 🌙
- Check status anytime with `./check_build_status.sh`

### Step 3: Review Results in the Morning

```bash
./check_build_status.sh
```

Then read [GOOD_MORNING.md](GOOD_MORNING.md) for complete results analysis.

## Alternative: Build Specific Feature

Don't want the full suite? Build just one feature:

```bash
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml exec -T superagent \
  python agent_system/cli.py kaya "build me <your feature>"
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# User authentication (4 tests)
kaya "build me user authentication: login, registration, password reset, OAuth"

# Payment checkout (3 tests)
kaya "build me payment checkout: view pricing, add to cart, complete purchase"

# Search functionality (3 tests)
kaya "build me search with text input, type filter dropdown, and date range filter"

# Export features (2 tests)
kaya "build me export to PDF and markdown with download verification"
```

## Monitoring Progress

While it runs (optional):

```bash
# Watch live logs
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml logs -f superagent

# Check status (doesn't interrupt build)
./check_build_status.sh

# View generated tests
ls -lh tests/*.spec.ts
```

## What Gets Generated

### Core Application Features (24 tests)
- Board Management (4 tests) - Create, edit, delete, persistence
- Node Operations (4 tests) - Add, edit, connect, delete nodes
- Export Functionality (3 tests) - PDF, Markdown, empty board
- Search & Filters (3 tests) - Text search, type filter, date filter
- Group Management (4 tests) - Create, rename, resize, add nodes, delete
- Canvas Navigation (3 tests) - Pan, zoom, reset, performance
- Media Upload (3 tests) - Images, videos, invalid formats

### Integration Features (9 tests)
- AI Chat Integration (3 tests) - Send message, get response, context
- Real-time Collaboration (3 tests) - Cursor tracking, live updates, conflict resolution
- RAG Training (3 tests) - Upload docs, embeddings, semantic search

### Critical Business Paths (7 tests)
- Authentication (4 tests) - Login, registration, reset, OAuth
- Billing & Pricing (3 tests) - View plans, upgrade, usage metrics

**Total: 40 comprehensive tests** covering all major features

## Requirements

Before starting:

1. **Docker running:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml ps
   ```
   Should show `superagent` container running.

2. **Anthropic API key set:**
   ```bash
   grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY .env
   ```
   Should show your key.

3. **VisionFlow context:**
   ```bash
   cat visionflow_context.md
   ```
   Should show data-testid selectors.

4. **Disk space:**
   ```bash
   df -h .
   ```
   Need ~500MB for tests + artifacts.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker not running
```bash
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### API key missing
```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx" >> .env
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml restart
```

### Previous build in progress
```bash
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml stop
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml start
```

### Want to start fresh
```bash
rm tests/*.spec.ts  # Delete old tests
./build_complete_test_suite.sh  # Regenerate
```

## Cost Breakdown

**Per test:**
- Scribe generation: $0.10 (Sonnet 4.5)
- Medic fix (if needed): $0.15 (Sonnet 4.5)
- Runner validation: $0 (local Playwright)

**Full suite (40 tests):**
- Scribe: 40 × $0.10 = $4.00
- Medic: ~15 fixes × $0.15 = $2.25
- Runner: $0
- **Total: ~$6.25**

**Value:**
- Manual writing: 40 tests × 30 min = 20 hours
- At $100/hr = $2,000 of developer time
- **ROI: 31,900%** 🤯

## Expected Timeline

```
00:00 - Start overnight build
00:05 - First tests generated
00:15 - ~5 tests complete
00:30 - ~10 tests complete
01:00 - ~15 tests complete
02:00 - ~25 tests complete
03:00 - ~35 tests complete
03:30 - Build complete (40 tests)
```

If a test fails validation:
- Medic attempts fix #1 (+2 min)
- Medic attempts fix #2 (+2 min)
- Medic attempts fix #3 (+2 min)
- If still failing, marks for review and continues

## Success Criteria

✅ **Excellent:** 38+ tests passing (95%+)
✅ **Good:** 35+ tests passing (87%+)
⚠️ **Needs Review:** <35 tests passing

Low pass rates usually mean:
- Missing data-testid attributes in app
- App not running at BASE_URL
- Database not seeded
- Authentication issues

See [GOOD_MORNING.md](GOOD_MORNING.md) for detailed troubleshooting.

## Next Steps After Success

1. **Review tests:** `ls -lh tests/*.spec.ts`
2. **Fix stragglers:** Address any failed tests (usually 2-5)
3. **Add to CI:** Integrate passing tests into CI pipeline
4. **Run regularly:** Keep test suite updated as features change
5. **Expand coverage:** Generate more edge case tests

## Files You'll Need

- `./test_autonomous_loop.sh` - Quick 5-minute validation
- `./build_complete_test_suite.sh` - Full overnight build
- `./check_build_status.sh` - Monitor progress
- `GOOD_MORNING.md` - Wake up and read this
- `AUTONOMOUS_BUILD.md` - Complete documentation

## The Big Picture

This is **the future of software testing:**

1. Voice/text command: "build me tests for X"
2. AI agents autonomously:
   - Break feature into tasks
   - Generate tests
   - Validate execution
   - Fix failures
   - Report results
3. Wake up to production-ready test suite

**No human intervention required.** Just review and deploy.
