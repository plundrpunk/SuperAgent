# Shell Alias for Easy Access

Add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc:

# SuperAgent Kaya - Use from anywhere!
alias kaya='cd /Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent && ./kaya'

Then reload your shell:
source ~/.zshrc

Now you can run from ANY directory:
kaya "fix all test failures"

---

# Optional: Add to PATH instead

Add this line to ~/.zshrc:
export PATH="/Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent:$PATH"

Then reload:
source ~/.zshrc

Now you can run:
kaya "write a test for login"

From ANY directory!
