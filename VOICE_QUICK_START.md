# üé§ Voice System - Quick Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. Lifecycle Bug (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: ServiceLifecycle was never marked as "started", so it rejected all tasks with "Service is shutting down"

**Fix**: Added `lifecycle.mark_started()` in `cli.py:99`

**Result**: ‚úÖ CLI now accepts tasks properly

### 2. Python Path in Voice Demo
**Problem**: `kaya_live_demo.ts` was calling system `python3` instead of venv Python, causing "No module named 'redis'" error

**Fix**: Changed spawn to use `/Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent/venv/bin/python`

**Result**: ‚úÖ Demo now uses correct Python with all dependencies

### 3. Environment Variables for Voice System
**Problem**: Voice TypeScript files couldn't find OPENAI_API_KEY

**Fix**:
- Copied `.env` to `agent_system/voice/.env`
- Added `dotenv.config()` to all TypeScript files

**Result**: ‚úÖ Voice system can access API keys

## üöß Current Blockers

### Redis Connection
**Issue**: `.env` has `REDIS_HOST=redis` (Docker hostname), but:
- Docker build is failing due to requirements.txt dependency conflicts
- Local system doesn't have Redis running

**Solutions** (pick one):

#### Option A: Use Localhost Redis (FASTEST)
```bash
# Install Redis locally (macOS)
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Then run with localhost:
cd agent_system/voice
REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js
```

#### Option B: Fix Docker & Use Containerized Redis
1. Fix `requirements.txt` dependency issues (still in progress)
2. Start Docker services: `docker compose up redis -d`
3. Run voice system: `node dist/text_chat.js` (uses `REDIS_HOST=redis` from .env)

#### Option C: Run Without Redis (Limited Functionality)
- Modify agents to work without Redis (not recommended)
- Lose state management, cost tracking, and voice transcripts

## üéØ Recommended Next Step

**Run the interactive text chat with localhost Redis:**

```bash
# 1. Install Redis (if not already installed)
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# 2. Test Redis is working
redis-cli ping  # Should return "PONG"

# 3. Run Kaya text chat
cd agent_system/voice
REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js

# 4. Type your first command
You: write a test for Cloppy AI authentication
```

## üìä What Works Right Now

‚úÖ **OpenAI Realtime API Connection** - Voice transcription and text synthesis
‚úÖ **Voice Orchestrator** - Event streaming, audio handling, text responses
‚úÖ **Intent Parser** - Parses voice commands into agent tasks
‚úÖ **CLI with Fixed Lifecycle** - Accepts and routes tasks properly
‚úÖ **Kaya Agent** - Routes commands to appropriate agents
‚úÖ **Scribe Agent** - Generates Playwright tests
‚úÖ **Cost Tracking** - Logs API usage and costs

## üîÑ In Progress

‚è≥ **Docker Build** - Still rebuilding with fixed requirements.txt
‚è≥ **Redis Setup** - Needs local install or Docker fix
‚è≥ **Observability Dashboard** - EventStream running but untested

## üé¨ Demo Commands to Try

Once Redis is running:

```bash
# Generate a test
write a test for Cloppy AI's board creation

# Run a test
run tests/cloppy_ai_board_creation.spec.ts

# Check status
what's the status?

# Validate with browser (uses Gemini)
validate the login flow - critical
```

## üí∞ Expected Costs

- **Scribe (test generation)**: ~$0.03-0.08 per test (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- **Runner (test execution)**: ~$0.001 per run (Claude Haiku)
- **Gemini (browser validation)**: ~$0.15-0.30 per validation (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- **Voice transcription**: ~$0.006 per minute (OpenAI Realtime API)

## üìù Files Modified in This Session

1. `agent_system/cli.py:99` - Added lifecycle.mark_started()
2. `agent_system/voice/kaya_live_demo.ts` - Fixed Python path
3. `agent_system/voice/examples.ts` - Added dotenv.config()
4. `agent_system/voice/text_chat.ts` - Created text interface
5. `CHAT_WITH_KAYA.md` - Updated with local instructions

## üêõ Known Issues to Fix

1. **requirements.txt**: Dependency version conflicts preventing Docker build
2. **Redis hostname**: Need to detect environment (Docker vs local) automatically
3. **Audio playback**: No media library to play PCM audio (text responses work fine)

---

**Bottom line**: Install Redis locally with `brew install redis && brew services start redis`, then run:

```bash
cd agent_system/voice
REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js
```

And you're chatting with Kaya! üéâ
