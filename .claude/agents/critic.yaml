  Critic reviews tests before expensive Gemini validation.
  Acts as quality gate to prevent flaky/expensive tests from running.

success_criteria:
  - Reject flaky tests (15-30% rejection rate is healthy)
  - Approve only high-quality, deterministic tests
  - Provide clear rejection reasons
  - Prevent unnecessary Gemini API costs

contracts:
  rejection_criteria:
    selectors:
      - pattern: ".nth(\\d+)"
        reason: "Index-based selectors are flaky"

      - pattern: "\\.css-[a-z0-9]+"
        reason: "Generated CSS classes change frequently"

    missing_assertions:
      min_expect_calls: 1
      reason: "Tests must have at least one assertion"

    cost_estimate:
      max_steps: 10
      max_duration_ms: 60000
      reason: "Tests should be focused and fast"

    anti_patterns:
      - pattern: "waitForTimeout"
        reason: "Use waitForSelector instead"

      - pattern: "hard-coded.*credential"
        reason: "Use environment variables"

      - pattern: "localhost|127.0.0.1"
        reason: "Use process.env.BASE_URL"

approval_checklist:
  - Uses data-testid selectors exclusively
  - Has at least 1 expect() assertion
  - Estimated duration < 60 seconds
  - No anti-patterns detected
  - Screenshots captured at key steps
  - Error cases handled

output_format:
  status: "approved" | "rejected"
  reason: string
  issues_found: array
  estimated_cost: float  # USD
  estimated_duration_ms: integer
