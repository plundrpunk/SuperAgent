# Closed-Loop Integration Test Summary

## Overview

Created comprehensive end-to-end integration test for the SuperAgent closed-loop workflow at:
**`/Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent/tests/integration/test_closed_loop.py`**

## Test Coverage

### Test Cases

#### 1. `test_closed_loop_happy_path`
**Flow**: Kaya → Scribe → Critic → Runner → Gemini → Success

Tests the complete happy path where all agents execute successfully without errors.

**Agents Involved**:
- Kaya (router)
- Scribe (test writer)
- Critic (pre-validator)
- Runner (test executor)
- Gemini (browser validator)

**Success Criteria**:
- All 5 agents execute successfully
- Cost under $0.50
- Execution time < 2 minutes
- Test file created and validated
- Browser validation passes with screenshots

**Key Validations**:
- Routing decision is correct (Haiku for easy task)
- Scribe generates valid test with data-testid selectors
- Critic approves test (no anti-patterns)
- Runner executes test successfully
- Gemini validates in real browser with screenshots
- Cost tracking across all agents
- Budget enforcement works

---

#### 2. `test_closed_loop_with_medic_fix`
**Flow**: Kaya → Scribe → Critic → Runner → Gemini (fails) → Medic fixes → Re-validate (passes)

Tests the complete flow with Medic intervention when a test fails validation.

**Agents Involved**:
- Kaya → Scribe → Critic → Runner → Gemini (6 agents total, including Medic)

**Failure Scenario**:
- Test fails Gemini validation with error: `Locator [data-testid="login-button"] not found`
- Medic diagnoses root cause
- Medic generates minimal surgical fix
- Medic runs regression tests (baseline + after-fix)
- Medic enforces Hippocratic Oath (max_new_failures: 0)

**Re-validation**:
- Runner executes fixed test
- Gemini re-validates (now passes)
- Final cost still under $0.50

**Success Criteria**:
- Medic successfully fixes the test
- Re-validation passes
- No regression (max_new_failures: 0)
- Cost tracked across all attempts
- Total cost < $0.50

**Key Validations**:
- Anthropic API mocked for Medic fix generation
- Regression tests run before/after fix
- Comparison shows 0 new failures
- Fix diagnosis is captured
- Confidence score is extracted from AI response
- Re-validation completes successfully

---

#### 3. `test_closed_loop_hitl_escalation`
**Flow**: Test fails → Medic attempts (3x) → Max retries exceeded → HITL escalation

Tests the HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) escalation workflow when Medic cannot fix the issue.

**Escalation Scenarios Tested**:

**Scenario A: Low Confidence Escalation**
- Medic generates fix with confidence 0.4 (below 0.7 threshold)
- Automatically escalates to HITL without applying fix
- HITL task includes AI diagnosis and confidence score

**Scenario B: Max Retries Escalation**
- Medic attempts fix 4 times
- Each fix causes regression (new_failures > 0)
- Fix is rolled back each time
- After 4th attempt (exceeds MAX_RETRIES=3), escalates to HITL

**Success Criteria**:
- Medic respects MAX_RETRIES limit (3)
- Task is escalated to HITL with full context
- HITL queue contains task with correct priority
- Cost tracked across all attempts
- Error message is clear about escalation reason

**HITL Task Structure Validated**:
```python
{
    'task_id': str,
    'feature': str,
    'code_path': str,
    'logs_path': str,
    'screenshots': List[str],
    'attempts': int,
    'last_error': str,
    'priority': float,  # 0.0-1.0
    'severity': str,  # low/medium/high/critical
    'escalation_reason': str,  # low_confidence, regression_detected, max_retries_exceeded
    'ai_diagnosis': str,
    'ai_confidence': float,
    'artifacts': dict
}
```

**Key Validations**:
- Redis tracks attempt count correctly
- Low confidence triggers escalation
- Regression detection triggers escalation
- Max retries triggers escalation
- HITL.add() called with correct task structure
- Priority calculated based on attempts + severity
- All escalation reasons are captured

---

#### 4. `test_cost_aggregation_across_agents`
Tests that costs are properly aggregated across all agents in the closed-loop.

**Cost Breakdown**:
```
kaya:    $0.000  (routing only, no LLM)
scribe:  $0.020  (Haiku for test generation)
critic:  $0.005  (Haiku for pre-validation)
runner:  $0.005  (Haiku for parsing)
gemini:  $0.000  (no API cost, just Playwright)
medic:   $0.000  (not needed in happy path)
-----------------------------------
TOTAL:   $0.030  (< $0.50 per-feature target)
```

**With Medic**:
```
Total with Medic fix: $0.045 (< $0.50)
```

**Key Validations**:
- Budget check returns 'ok' status
- Total cost under $0.50 per-feature target
- Total cost under $5.00 per-session limit
- Remaining budget calculated correctly
- Cost breakdown by agent is accurate

---

## Test Architecture

### Mocking Strategy

**External APIs (Mocked)**:
- Anthropic API (for Scribe and Medic)
- Playwright subprocess execution
- Browser screenshot capture

**State Clients (Mocked)**:
- Redis client (session, task status, attempt tracking)
- Vector DB client (test patterns, annotations)
- HITL queue (task escalation)

**Real Components**:
- All agent classes (Kaya, Scribe, Runner, Critic, Gemini, Medic)
- Router (complexity estimation, routing decisions)
- Validation rubric
- State management logic

### Fixtures

**`setup_teardown` (autouse)**:
- Creates temporary directory for test files
- Initializes mock state clients
- Configures mock Redis, Vector DB, and HITL queue
- Cleans up after test

### Key Features

1. **Complete Agent Coordination**: Tests all 6 agents working together
2. **Cost Tracking**: Validates cost accumulation across agents
3. **Error Recovery**: Tests Medic fix workflow
4. **HITL Escalation**: Tests escalation scenarios (low confidence, max retries, regression)
5. **Regression Safety**: Validates Medic's Hippocratic Oath (max_new_failures: 0)
6. **Budget Enforcement**: Tests cost limits and budget checks
