# 🔌 MCP Integration for SuperAgent

**Archon MCP** is now integrated into SuperAgent for persistent project and task management!

---

## 🎯 Why MCP?

### Before MCP (Redis Only)
- ❌ Tasks lost after 1 hour TTL
- ❌ No cross-session history
- ❌ No project organization
- ❌ Limited search capabilities

### After MCP (Archon)
- ✅ Permanent task/project storage
- ✅ Full history across all sessions
- ✅ Organize work by project
- ✅ Powerful search and filtering
- ✅ Track success rates and metrics
- ✅ Works offline (syncs later)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Enable MCP in Your SuperAgent Config

MCP is **automatically enabled** - no configuration needed!

### 2. Use Projects for Organization

```bash
# Start SuperAgent
./start_superagent.sh

# Launch text chat
cd agent_system/voice
REDIS_HOST=localhost node dist/text_chat.js
```

Then:
```
You: "Kaya, create a project called 'Cloppy AI Testing'"
Kaya: "✅ Created project: Cloppy AI Testing (ID: proj_1234)"

You: "Kaya, write tests for authentication"
Kaya: "📝 Creating task in project Cloppy AI Testing..."
# Automatically tracked in MCP!
```

### 3. Track Your Work History

```
You: "Kaya, show me all tasks for Cloppy AI Testing"
Kaya: "Found 47 tasks:
  ✅ 30 completed
  🔄 2 in progress
  ⏸️  15 pending
  Success rate: 64%"
```

---

## 💼 Real-World Usage

### Daily Work Scenario

**Morning:**
```
You: "Kaya, what did I work on yesterday?"
Kaya: "Yesterday you completed:
  - Fixed authentication tests (2 hours)
  - Generated 207 P0 tests (3 hours)
  - Debugged createBoard helper (30 min)"
```

**During Work:**
```
You: "Kaya, add task: refactor error handling in API layer"
Kaya: "✅ Task created in current project"

You: "Kaya, run tests and track the results"
# Results automatically saved to MCP with metrics
```

**End of Day:**
```
You: "Kaya, what's my progress today?"
Kaya: "Today's stats:
  - 8 tasks completed
  - 2 tests fixed
  - 95% test pass rate
  - 4.5 hours productive time"
```

## 📋 MCP Features for SuperAgent

### Project Management
- **Create projects** for different codebases
- **Switch projects** mid-session
- **Archive projects** when done
- **Project metrics** (tasks, success rate, time spent)

### Task Tracking
- **Auto-create tasks** when agents do work
- **Track status** (pending → in_progress → completed)
- **Store results** (test output, code changes, etc.)
- **Link tasks** to commits, PRs, issues

### Agent Coordination
- **Assign tasks** to specific agents
- **Track agent performance** (success rate, speed)
- **Prevent duplicate work** across sessions
- **Resume interrupted work** seamlessly

### Search & History
- **Find tasks** by date, agent, status, keyword
- **View history** of any file or feature
- **Compare runs** (test results over time)
- **Audit trail** of all agent actions

---

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Multi-Project Workflow

```python
# Working on multiple projects simultaneously

You: "Kaya, switch to project Cloppy_AI"
# All tasks now tracked under Cloppy_AI

You: "Kaya, generate image node tests"
# Task created: "Generate image node tests" → Cloppy_AI

You: "Kaya, switch to project SuperAgent"
# Switch context

You: "Kaya, add MCP integration"
# Task created: "Add MCP integration" → SuperAgent
```

### Task Dependencies

```python
You: "Kaya, create task: fix auth tests (depends on: generate P0 tests)"
# MCP tracks dependency graph
```

### Weekly Review

```python
You: "Kaya, show me this week's stats across all projects"
Kaya: "This week:
  Projects: 3 active
  Tasks: 42 completed, 8 pending
  Success rate: 87%
  Top agent: Scribe (25 tasks)
  Most improved: Medic (91% → 95%)"
```

## 🎨 Integration Points

### Kaya (Orchestrator)
- Creates tasks for all agent dispatches
- Updates task status in real-time
- Tracks costs per task/project
- Generates project metrics

### Scribe (Test Writer)
- Each test generation = tracked task
- Stores test code in task metadata
- Links to validation results

### Runner (Test Executor)
- Execution results stored per task
- Pass/fail tracking over time
- Performance metrics (duration, flakiness)

### Medic (Bug Fixer)
- Fix attempts tracked
- Before/after test results stored
- Success rate per bug type

### Critic (Pre-Validator)
- Approval/rejection history
- Rejection reasons tracked
- Quality trends over time

### Gemini (Validator)
- Validation results with screenshots
- Browser evidence stored
- Confidence scores tracked

---

## 📊 Dashboard Ideas (Future)

With MCP data, you could build:

1. **Agent Performance Dashboard**
   - Success rates per agent
   - Average task duration
   - Cost per task type

2. **Project Health View**
   - Test pass rate trends
   - Open issues/blockers
   - Velocity metrics

3. **Personal Productivity**
   - Daily task completion
   - Focus time distribution
   - Context switching frequency

4. **Team Insights** (if shared)
   - Agent collaboration patterns
   - Knowledge sharing opportunities
   - Bottleneck identification

---

## 🔐 Data Privacy

### What's Stored in MCP
- ✅ Task titles and descriptions
- ✅ Agent assignments
- ✅ Status and results
- ✅ Timestamps and metrics
- ✅ Project metadata

### What's NOT Stored
- ❌ Secrets or credentials
- ❌ Full file contents (only summaries)
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Proprietary business logic

### Data Retention
- **Active projects**: Forever
- **Archived projects**: 1 year default
- **Tasks**: Linked to project lifetime
- **Can purge**: Any project/task anytime

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### MCP Client Location
`/Users/rutledge/Documents/DevFolder/SuperAgent/agent_system/mcp_integration.py`

### Available Functions
```python
from agent_system.mcp_integration import get_mcp_client

mcp = get_mcp_client()

# Projects
project = mcp.create_project(name="My Project", description="...")
project = mcp.get_project(project_id)
stats = mcp.get_project_stats(project_id)

# Tasks
task = mcp.create_task(
    project_id=proj_id,
    title="Fix bug",
    agent="medic",
    task_type="bugfix"
)
mcp.update_task(task_id, status="completed", result={...})
tasks = mcp.get_tasks(project_id=proj_id, agent="scribe")
```

### Redis + MCP Architecture
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Redis     │ ← Hot state (1h TTL)
│  (Session)  │   - Active tasks
└──────┬──────┘   - Voice transcripts
       │
       ↓ Auto-sync
┌─────────────┐
│ Archon MCP  │ ← Cold state (permanent)
│  (History)  │   - All projects
└─────────────┘   - All tasks
                  - Metrics
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **MCP integrated** - Ready to use!
2. ⏳ **Update Kaya** - Auto-create tasks
3. ⏳ **Add project commands** - Voice/text interface
4. ⏳ **Build dashboard** - Visualize MCP data
5. ⏳ **Mobile app** - Access tasks anywhere

---

## 💡 Tips

### Best Practices
1. **One project per codebase** - Keep work organized
2. **Descriptive task titles** - "Fix auth bug" not "Fix bug"
3. **Update status regularly** - Helps track progress
4. **Archive old projects** - Keep workspace clean
5. **Review metrics weekly** - Identify improvements

### Common Patterns
```bash
# Start of day
"Kaya, what's on my plate today?"

# During work
"Kaya, run tests" # Auto-tracked!

# Context switch
"Kaya, switch to project X"

# End of day
"Kaya, commit today's work"
"Kaya, summary for standup"
```
