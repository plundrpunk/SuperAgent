# Overnight Build Analysis - In Progress

## Status: RUNNING ⚙️

Build started and is autonomously attempting to generate tests.

## Issues Detected

### 1. RAG Search Not Finding Results ⚠️

**Problem**: 
```
WARNING: No results found for query: test_generation /app/tests/board_management:_create.spec.ts
```

**Root Cause**: Query is too specific and includes file path which doesn't exist in knowledge base.

**Recommendation**: 
Update Medic's RAG query to use simpler terms:
```python
# Instead of this:
query = f"test_generation {test_file_path}"

# Use this:
query = "button click data-testid"  # Extract keywords from error
```

### 2. Tests Failing with Load Errors ❌

**Error**: "Test failed after 3 fix attempts: 2 load error(s)"

**Possible Causes**:
1. VisionFlow not accessible at `http://host.docker.internal:5175`
2. BASE_URL environment variable not set correctly
3. Network connectivity issues between containers

**Check**:
```bash
# From SuperAgent container
docker exec superagent-app curl http://host.docker.internal:5175

# Check if VisionFlow is running
docker ps | grep visionflow
```

## Recommendations

### Quick Fix: Simplify RAG Queries

Update `agent_system/agents/medic.py` to extract keywords from errors:

```python
def search_for_patterns(self, error_message, test_path):
    # Extract keywords from error
    keywords = []
    if "button" in error_message.lower():
        keywords.append("button")
    if "click" in error_message.lower():
        keywords.append("click")
    if "selector" in error_message.lower():
        keywords.append("data-testid")
    
    # Simple 2-3 keyword query
    query = " ".join(keywords[:3])  # Max 3 keywords
    
    return archon.search_knowledge_base(query, match_count=5)
```

### Check VisionFlow Accessibility

```bash
# Is VisionFlow running?
docker ps --filter "name=visionflow"

# Can SuperAgent reach it?
docker exec superagent-app curl -I http://host.docker.internal:5175
```

### Alternative: Use Localhost Tests

If VisionFlow isn't running, update BASE_URL to use a test server or mock:

```bash
# In .env
BASE_URL=http://example.com  # For syntax testing only
```

## Current Progress

- ✅ Archon integration working (projects/tasks being created)
- ✅ Scribe generating tests
- ✅ Runner executing tests
- ✅ Medic attempting fixes
- ⚠️ RAG searches returning 0 results (query too specific)
- ❌ Tests failing with load errors (VisionFlow connectivity)

## Next Steps

1. **Let it run** - See if subsequent features work better
2. **Check logs** - Monitor for patterns in failures
3. **Simplify RAG queries** - Update Medic to use 2-3 keywords max
4. **Verify VisionFlow** - Ensure target app is accessible

## Cost So Far

Approximately $1-2 spent on:
- Scribe generations (Sonnet 4.5)
- Medic fix attempts (3 per test)
- Runner validations (Haiku)

Build will continue until all features complete or fail.
